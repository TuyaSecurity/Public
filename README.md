# 涂鸦智能 - 已知漏洞报告声明

涂鸦将所有已知漏洞说明的文件归档并计算出对应文件hash。所有的hash值被放在一个列表文件中。这里公布的是该列表文件的值。

当存在漏洞奖励计划争议时，涂鸦会提供对应hash列表文件、具体漏洞说明文件及其hash值，以证明该漏洞已经被他人提交。

# Description

Tuya archives all the files with known vulnerabilities and calculates the corresponding file hash. All the hash values are put in several list files. Published here are the hash values of these list files.

When there is a dispute over the vulnerability reward plan, Tuya will provide the corresponding hash list file, specific vulnerability description file and its hash value to prove that the vulnerability has been submitted by others.
